Hello there,

I'm developing a program to create a list of all the custom GPTs available online, send a specific prompt to each, and save the response. I need help with the following tasks:

1. **Identify Custom GPTs**: I need to find a method to compile a list of all custom GPTs. Can you help me explore how to gather this information from various platforms?
2. **Python Code Generation**: Assist in generating Python code to retrieve the list of custom GPTs, including their names and descriptions.
3. **Interaction and Response Collection**: Help me understand how to send a prompt to each custom GPT and save their responses. I considered using Selenium for web scraping as I couldn't find an API for custom GPTs.
4. **Final CSV Structure**: I need to generate a CSV file with the following columns: 
   - **Name**: The custom GPT's name
   - **Type**: Should be "CustomGPT"
   - **Description**: The custom GPT's description
   - **Injected Prompt**: The prompt I sent to the GPT
   - **GPT Prompt**: The response received from the GPT
   - **Origin**: The platform (currently only ChatGPT)
   - **Origin URL**: The custom GPT's URL

Here's an example of my current CSV table with three items:

```
Name               Type        Description            Injected Prompt                            GPT Prompt                                           Origin  Origin URL
